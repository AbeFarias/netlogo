# netlogo
A group project for my Computer Simulations course.
This model simulates the spread of an infectious disease traveling via air through
a randomly moving population.  The user can draw walls, buildings, or obstacles in the
environment to simulate different environments. The only issue I could foresee someone
running into is that some aspects do not work on newer versions of NetLogo.
